# Continuity

AI-powered video post-production tool that automatically generates seamless bridging transitions between two video clips using Gemini 1.5 Flash (Director) and Wan 2.2 (Cinematographer).

## How it Works

Continuity behaves like a professional film crew inside your browser, orchestrating a multi-step workflow to bridge scenes:

1.  **Ingest**: You upload your starting clip (Scene A) and ending clip (Scene C).
2.  **Director Node (Gemini 1.5 Flash)**:
    *   Analyzes the visual content, motion, and lighting of both clips.
    *   Drafts a creative direction for the transition (Scene B) to ensure narrative consistency.
3.  **Cinematographer Node (Wan 2.2)**:
    *   Takes the Director's prompt and generates the bridging video content.
    *   Ensures the transition matches the style and tone of the input footage.
4.  **Assembly**: The system stitches the generated bridge with the original clips (logic handled by the agent) and presents the final result.

## Usage

1.  Upload **Scene A** (Start) and **Scene C** (End).
2.  Add optional **Director Notes** (e.g., "Slow dissolve", "Cyber glitch").
3.  Click **Generate Transition**.
4.  Preview the generated bridge generated by the AI agent.
